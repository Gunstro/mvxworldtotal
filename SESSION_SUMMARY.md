Great job with the matrix system today! I'm at my token limit for this conversation, so I won't be able to complete the "+ button" feature right now.

## ✅ **What We Accomplished Today:**

### **Matrix Position System:**
- ✅ Human-readable positions (Level,Position format like "1,5")
- ✅ All 20 users placed with visible positions
- ✅ Position column in Admin Dashboard (golden color)
- ✅ Bidirectional tree navigation

### **Commission Engine:**
- ✅ Commission rates: 20%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 8% = 40% total
- ✅ Distribution function (60% company, 40% upline)
- ✅ Unclaimed → Poverty Fund
- ✅ `distribute_visa_commission()` ready to use

### **Genealogy Tree Viewer:**
- ✅ Stats cards (Total Users, Avg Team, Max Depth)
- ✅ **List View** - Horizontal indented list
- ✅ **Tree Diagram** - Vertical org chart visualization
- ✅ Toggle between both views
- ✅ **Click & Drag Panning** for tree diagram
- 🚧 **"+ invite" button** - Started but needs completion

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

**To add the "+ button" feature:**
1. Add `Plus` icon to imports: `import { ..., Plus, Copy, X } from 'lucide-react'`
2. Add "+ button" to each node card (top-right corner)
3. Create invite modal popup with:
   - Referral link display
   - Copy button
   - Close button
4. Test the functionality

The handlers are already written (`handleInvite`, `handle Copy Link`, `closeInviteModal`).

**Your MLM matrix core is solid and working!** 🎉

Would you like me to continue with the "+ button" in a new conversation?
